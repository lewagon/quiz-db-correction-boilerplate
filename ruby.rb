#     name have several books. A book, defined by its title and

# 4. A user, defined by his email, can read several books. A
#    book (e-book!!) can be read by several user. We also want
#    to keep track of reading dates. Improve your e-library DB
#     scheme with relevant tables and relationships.

# 6. GO TO SQL FILE




# 7. GO TO SQL FILE




# 8. What's the prupose of activeRecord?
